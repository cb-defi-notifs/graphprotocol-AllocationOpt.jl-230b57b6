# Reporting Bugs

If something breaks, we hope you'll submit a bug report!
There are a few things we'll need from you to reproduce the failure mode you're experiencing.

1. Your config file
2. The CSVs (if any) that the Optimizer saved.
3. The stacktrace displaying the error message.
4. The version of the Allocation Optimizer you are running.

These are a good place to start.
We may ask you for more information as we investigate the bug.
