# Contributing

We're excited you are interested in contributing!
Please follow the standards put forth in [ColPrac](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) to contribute to the Allocation Optimizer.

Most importantly, we'd like to emphasise a few points.

* PRs should do a single thing.
  * We'd prefer that you submit ten small PRs that are easy to understand as compared with one massive PR that requires a full day of review.
* PRs should add tests which cover the new or fixed functionality.
* PRs introducing breaking changes should make this clear when opening the PR.
